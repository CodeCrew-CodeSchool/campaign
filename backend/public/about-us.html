    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>
      SmartEmailer is the brainchild of <strong>Bruce Brown</strong> and <strong>Kadarius Clemons</strong>. 
      Both of us attended <em>Code Crew's Code School</em>, where we learned the skills to turn ideas into real software. 
      Inspired by the challenge of automating marketing and making email outreach more accessible, we combined our coding knowledge and creativity to build SmartEmailer.
    </p>

    <h3>Why We Built SmartEmailer</h3>
    <p>
      We believe that technology should simplify your work, not complicate it. SmartEmailer was designed to give you more time to focus on what matters—growing your business, connecting with your customers, and building relationships. 
      Our goal is to empower anyone, regardless of technical skill, to create meaningful, personalized email campaigns with confidence.
